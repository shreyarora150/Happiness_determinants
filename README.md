# Happiness_determinants
3 factorial 3 level design of experiment to study effects of physical, cognitive and spiritual activities on output hapiness score and study their interactions.   

Happiness is a subjective emotion that brings about positive feelings and a sense of contentment and fulfillment. It is closely linked with mental, physical, and spiritual health. Research has shown that people who are happier tend to have better mental health, including lower rates of depression and anxiety, as well as better physical health, with reduced risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. Moreover, spiritual well-being has also been associated with increased happiness, with individuals who report higher levels of spiritual well-being reporting greater levels of overall happiness and life satisfaction. Thus, cultivating happiness through various means such as self-care, meaningful relationships, and spiritual practices can have a positive impact on one's overall well-being.

The objective of this research is to study how physical activities like playing sports or running, cognitive activities like reading a book or coursework, and recreational or spiritual activities like meditation or writing and composing music can affect your happiness and productivity level as measured through self assessed scores.
